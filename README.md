This is a Arduino project make long time ago. 

Using Arduino Nano with DHT22, Bluetooth client, 4 digits 8 segments LED and a relay.

On my usage, relay is controlling a dump heater. When temperature is lower then threshold, then power to heater. And temperature higher them threshold cut off the heater.

That also send temperature and humidity to bluetooth. (Bluetooth config not included in this project.)

Those photos may not included connection to relay. (I don't remember =.=")
